                <h3>Changes to Gamehub</h3>
                <h4 class="topics">-The home page layout-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                I changed the layout of the home page.
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the positioning of the pictures and their sizes. I also changed the font-family, so that all headers
                have the same font-style. The font-size was made a little bigger. The main picture was changed on mobile size, so that
                it looks better and the text can be bigger on smaller screens.</p>
                
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this because i wanted the page to look better on all screen sizes.</p>
               
                <h4 class="topics">-Game pages-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the design of the game pages.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the design, so that all new games are on one page instead of three. Instead I have the different categories
                    on the same page. This made it possible to remove the dropdown menu on the 'game' selection on the menu, and makes
                    the menu more consistent in style. I also removed the decorative picture on the side so that the site is less overwhelming.
                    The buttons now are introduced by JS and not in the HTML.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this because I think the presentation of the games was a little overwhelming and also led to difficulties in
                    presenting the site on smaller screens. I also wanted to remove the drop down menu on the menu, and rather have all new games
                    presented on one site.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Filter functionality-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I inserted two filter options on the game page, one for prices and one for platforms. </p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p> The filter options are presented in two separate dropdown selection menus, one for price and one for platforms.
                    These options are presented both on the 'new game' page as well as the 'used game' page.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>Since I had compressed the three game category pages to just one, IÂ thought it would be nice for the user to have
                    a few more ways of finding different sets of games. I decided to have one for price (as can be seen on nintendo e-shop for instance)
                    and one for platforms. This way the user don't have to scroll through all games to find the ones they're looking for.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Colors on menu-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the color of the menu and also its hover colors</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p> I changed the color of the menu from the dark blue in the logo to black. Also i changed the color of hover/active
                    from black to the same red as is seen in other parts of the page.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p> I originally decided to use the same color for the menu as is seen in the logo to ensure consistency, but the dark blue 
                    really didn't feel right and I don't think it is the best choice of color for a game page. I think black makes the site look
                    better and is stronger and better represent gaming. Also the red hover color is a good contrast to black and is repeated on different 
                    pages of the site.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Font size-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the font size of the text on smaller screen sizes</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p> The font-size was changed to that of the desktop versions.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p> As part of the feedback I was informed that the text formatting should be more consistent. Therefore I changed it
                    so that the paragraph text is the same across all screen sizes.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Added to the contact form functionality-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I disabled the submit button, and enabled it upon completing the form</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p> I added functionality so that the button is grey and unclickable until the form is complete at which point 
                    the button turns purple indicating interactivity.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p> Prior to this change the error messages was shown only when the user moved away from the field, but the user could still
                    click the button and submit, so this was a mistake I have failed to correct before. I therefore added this functionality, so that
                    the user cannot click the form before completion and also gets error messages if moving on prematurely.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Removed sidebar-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I removed sidebar on all pages</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p> I removed the sidebar and stretced the main content out.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p> I wanted the user to focus on the main content of the site without getting disturbed by the content in 
                    the sidebar. The sidebar contained 'used games' that was recently put out for sale, but these can
                    easily be found on the used game page.

                <h3>Changes to Community Science</h3>

                <h4 class="topics">-Newsletter form feedback-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I had included a newsletter form in the footer section of the site, making it possible for customers
                to receive news about special exhibitions etc. Since we had not learned about JS at the time, I now thought it was good to have
                some feedback on the form.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I added feedback upon clicking the "Subscribe" button by adding form validation, so the user now has to fill out name and e-mail correctly in 
                order to be able to send the form. If not filled out correctly the user gets info on what is missing.
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this, because feedback is an important part of the user experience. A form that
                has no validation what so ever can be quite confusing and lead to frustration.</p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Background Pictures-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>As part of the feedback on semester project I was informed that the background pictures made the
                site a little more confusing than having just a plain background, white or  some other color. I took this into
                consideration and removed them, except on the pages for the different exhibitions.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I removed most of the pictures, and instead added a plain color.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this, because the impression the user gets when entering the site can be a little 
                overwhelming. Also for people who are sensitive to color all the colors and patterns might cause
                confusion and frustration.</p>
                

                <h4 class="topics">-The hover content on search-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>The hover content did not work quite as planned when hovering over the search icon on the nav menu, so I
                redid this.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the styling of the elements and their positioning, so that the hover content now is easily
                accessed, both on desktop sizes as well as mobile sizes.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this, as it is important that the user can navigate the website without difficulty, but easily
                to the "desired destinations". It is therefore important that the functionality for different parts works
                as intended.</p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Font Size-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the font size on the smaller screens, so that the formatting is more consistent across all screens.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I made the font-size on smaller screens as large as the desktop versions, so that is the content can be easily
                read.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed it because I initially had smaller letters on smaller sizes as I thougth this was normal, but I got feedback
                that the text formatting should be more consistent and it looks better this way.</p>
                

                <h4 class="topics">-Layout on specific exhibition pages-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the pictures on these sites from being large background pictures to smaller ones and so I had to change the overall
                layout of these pages.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the text positioning as well as opacity on different screen sizes,
                so that the content would look good on desktop as well as on mobile screens.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>As I removed the big background imageds from the other pages I figured I needed to do the same here. However, with
                this change the overall layout too had to be changed in order to make the pages look good, so I had to "clean up" the page.</p>
            

                <h4 class="topics">-Responsiveness-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the responsiveness of the website, especially on the home page.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the positioning of the pictures and also redid the main picture with the text on smaller screen sizes.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed this as I was not satisfied with the look an smaller sizes. The text on the main picture was not 
                    completely inside borders of the picture so I redid this, which was easier now that I have more experience.
                </p>

                <h4 class="topics">-Color of hyperlinks-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                <p>I changed the color of the hyperlinks from orange to dark blue.</p>
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                <p>I changed the color from a light orange to dark blue, so that the contrast is more apparent.
                </p>
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                <p>The color of light orange on white for the links can be difficult for some people too see, so I changed it to
                    a color which contrast is strong against the white background.
