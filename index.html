                <h3>Changes to Community Science</h3>

                <h4 class="topics">-Newsletter form feedback-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                I had included a newsletter form in the footer section of the site, making it possible for customers
                to receive news about special exhibitions etc. Since we had not learned about JS at the time, I now thought it was good to have
                some feedback on the form.
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                I added feedback upon clicking the "Subscribe" button by adding form validation, so the user now has to fill out name and e-mail correctly in 
                order to be able to send the form. If not filled out correctly the user gets info on what is missing.
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                I changed this, because feedback is an important part of the user experience. A form that
                has no validation what so ever can be quite confusing and lead to frustration.

                <h4 class="topics">-Background Pictures-</h4>
                <p class="text-categories">What I changed</p>
                As part of the feedback on semester project I was informed that the background pictures made the
                site a little more confusing than having just a plain background, white or  some other color. I took this into
                consideration and removed them, except on the pages for the different exhibitions.
                <p class="text-categories">How I changed it</p>
                I removed most of the pictures, and instead added a plain color.
                <p class="text-categories">Why I changed it</p>
                I changed this, because the impression the user gets when entering the site can be a little 
                overwhelming. Also for people who are sensitive to color all the colors and patterns might cause
                confusion and frustration.
